Game Feel:

I focused on improving the overall game feel to make the experience smooth and enjoyable.

1. The player movement controller is smooth and responsive.

2. Cute plant models are used for both the player and enemies to create a friendly look.

3. A good-looking environment is designed to support the visual style.

4. Particles and sound effects are added to give better feedback to player actions.

5. Post-processing is used in an optimized way on a small level to improve visuals without affecting performance.

6. Subtle camera shake effects are used to add impact and make actions feel more dynamic.
